# This is an motherfucking index.md

It's even more fucking perfect than the other motherfucking index.md's. And why is that, you fuck?

## __Hipstered domain extension and beautiful typography.__

We all know that Motherfucking Website ― *MFW* ― it's grotesque pile of shit. And we also know that Better Motherfucking Website ― *BMFW* ― improved the *Ass-Blastered Crap* into an (almost) easy-to-read masterpiece. But I made it even better! Like the other motherfucking websites, __Even Better Motherfucking Website__ ― *EBMFW* ―, has all of the glory that the original, 'perfect-ass' website has - along with some improvements from the *BMFW*:

- 👋 Shit's still lightweight and loads fast;
- 👀 Still fits on all of your shitty screens;
- 🌱 Still looks the same in all of your shitty browsers;
- 💞️ This motherfucker's still accessible to every asshole that visits your site;
- 📫 Shit's still legible and gets your fucking point across;
- :joy: Plus a hipstered domain extension and beautiful typography.

## Yes, this continues to be fucking satirical, fuckers

Like the creator of Better Motherfucking Website, I ♥ what the creator of Motherfucking Website did. It's all about the message! But let's face it: would you rather have crap, or some beautifully-aligned shit?
